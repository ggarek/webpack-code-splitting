# Code spitting strategy

- [ ] Split by manually defining entry points
- [ ] Split by using dynamic import
- [ ] Split by using bundle loader
- [ ] Split by using promise loader

# TODOs

- [ ] Add build output results
- [ ] Compare bundles between builds (% of similar code between all js artifacts)
- [ ] Provide package analyzer results

# Notes 

CommonChunksPlugin is an optimization and can be used with any mentioned code splitting strategy.
